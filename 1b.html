<p>First of all, it was October, a rare month for boys. Not that all months aren't rare.But there be
bad and good, as the pirates say. Take September, a bad month: school begins. Consider
August, a good month: school hasn't begun yet. July, well, July's really fine: there's no chance in
the world for school. June, no doubting it, June's best of all, for the school doors spring wide
and September's a billion years away.</p>

<hr/>
<p>But you take October, now.School's been on a month and you're riding easier in the reins,
jogging along.You got time to think of the garbage you'll dump on old man Prickett's porch, or
the hairy-ape costume you'll wear to the YMCA the last night of the month.And if it's around
October twentieth and everything smoky-smelling and the sky orange and ash grey at twilight,
it seems Hallowe'en will never come in a fall of broomsticks and a soft flap of bedsheets around
corners.</p>
